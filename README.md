# Port of Quake 2 re-release game source to Q2PRO

Port of Quake 2 re-release game source designed to run with modified version of
Q2PRO, with all KEX-specific APIs removed. The goal of this project is to make
re-release single player campaign playable in Q2PRO.

This game library will *not* run on standard Quake 2 server, modified Q2PRO
server and client built from experimental branch is required! This is a work in
progress, don't expect it to function properly yet.

Source code currently builds on Linux with Meson.
