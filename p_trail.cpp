PLAYER TRAIL

==============================================================================

This is a two-way list containing the a list of points of where
the player has been recently. It is used by monsters for pursuit.

This is improved from vanilla; now, the list itself is stored in
client data so it can be stored for multiple clients.

chain = next
enemy = prev

The head node will always have a null "chain", the tail node
will always have a null "enemy".
